# Crowdfunding_ETL

For the ETL mini project, I built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, I created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, I uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

This mini project are divided into the following subsections:
1. Category and Subcategory DataFrames
2. Campaign DataFrame
3. Contacts DataFrame
4. Crowdfunding Database

## Category and Subcategory DataFrames
I extracted and transformed the crowdfunding.xlsx Excel data to create a category DataFrame and a subcategory DataFrame and then exported them into CSV files.

## Campaign DataFrame
I extracted and transformed the crowdfunding.xlsx Excel data to create a campaign DataFrame and exported it into a CSV file.

## Contacts DataFrame
Using Python dictionary methods, I extracted and transformed the contacts.xlsx Excel data to create a contacts DataFrame and exported it into a CSV file.

## Crowdfunding Database
After creating the 4 CSV files, I used them to create an ERD. Using the ERD, I created a table schema for each CSV file in which I created a table for each CSV file and imported data into the tables from the files.
